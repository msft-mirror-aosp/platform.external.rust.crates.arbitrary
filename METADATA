description:
    "The Arbitrary crate lets you construct arbitrary instance of a type."
    ""
    "This crate is primarily intended to be combined with a fuzzer like "
    "libFuzzer and cargo-fuzz or AFL, and to help you turn the raw, untyped "
    "byte buffers that they produce into well-typed, valid, structured values. "
    "This allows you to combine structure-aware test case generation with "
    "coverage-guided, mutation-based fuzzers."
